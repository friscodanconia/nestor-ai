    description: "AI tutors provide personalized guidance and support for learners across various subjects. These virtual assistants can answer questions, explain concepts, and guide students through problem-solving processes.\n\nUnlike static educational content, AI tutors can engage in interactive dialogues, adapt explanations based on student responses, and provide scaffolded support that gradually decreases as students gain mastery. While they lack the emotional intelligence and deep subject expertise of human tutors, they offer advantages in terms of availability, patience, and consistency.",
